# @uniswap/merkle-distributor

# ğŸ“¦ A modified merkle-distributor from uniswap that can be used to generate merkle distributor in projects.

### to those who have used the original package one change to take note of:
- The `OldFormat` type now accepts a hex string only for the amount same as the new format (check `old_format_example.json`), this is to ensure accuracy with computation especially when dealing with an amount with decimals places in the project side.
